# 🦋 Monarch: A Modular System for Verified Reasoning and GPT-Assisted Planning

**Monarch** is a composable, formally-specified reasoning and planning framework that combines:
- A custom DSL (Monarch Core Language) with verified I/O semantics
- A recursive goal decomposition engine (PlanCore)
- GPT-assisted abstraction, simplification, and fallback generation
- An evolving, legible DAG memory structure with metadata and versioning
- Optional integration with existing Python packages via secure import wrappers

> Monarch empowers agents to decompose complex goals into verified execution plans, using both symbolic reasoning and neural suggestions, all while guaranteeing correctness through formal spec compliance.

## 🧠 Core Modules

| Module      | Description                                                                 |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `PlanCore`  | Recursive planner that decomposes goals into verified modules inspired by the heuristics of George Polya ('How to Solve it')            |
| `Interpreter` | Executes plans written in the Monarch DSL, verifying each step formally |
| `SpecEngine` | Validates module I/O with pre/postconditions and type guarantees          |
| `GPTAssist` | Interfaces with GPT for fallback plan generation and heuristic ranking     |
| `DAGMemory` | Graph-based log of all approved plans, reusable components, and metadata   |
| `TypeLatticeWalker` (optional) | Explores generalization space for abstractions          |

## 🔧 Features

- ✅ **Formal Verification at Every Step:** All modules and plans are checked against their I/O specifications.
- 🔁 **Recursive Planning:** Break goals into reusable, verifiable sub-plans with dependency-aware execution.
- 💡 **GPT Suggestions:** GPT can propose modules, simplify plans, or provide heuristics—always subject to verification.
- 📚 **Composable Modules:** Build systems from core primitives or wrapped Python packages with declared specs.
- 🌱 **Evolving Memory:** Every plan you approve becomes part of an ever-growing library of verified modules and subgraphs.

## 📦 Example Workflow

```python
from monarch.plancore import Plan
from monarch.gpt_assist import GPTSuggest
from monarch.memory import DAGMemory

# Define a high-level goal
goal = "Sort a list of integers and return the unique ones"

# Recursively plan
plan = Plan(goal)
plan.generate()                # Recursively decomposes using known modules
plan.simplify_with_gpt()       # Optionally calls GPT for suggestions
plan.verify()                  # All steps must pass I/O type and logic checks
plan.save_to_memory()          # Stores to DAG memory for future reuse
🧪 Getting Started
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-org/monarch.git
cd monarch
pip install -r requirements.txt
To run the interpreter on a Monarch plan:

bash
Copy
Edit
python run.py examples/sort_and_unique.plan.json
📜 Monarch DSL Primer
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "goal": "Filter even numbers",
  "steps": [
    { "module": "List.Filter", "input": "x % 2 == 0", "source": "input_list" }
  ]
}
Every .plan.json file is a formally-verified program composed of reusable modules.

🛡️ Philosophy
Monarch is built on the principle that:

Reasoning must be verifiable

Neural assistance must be grounded

Planning must be legible and composable

It’s a new kind of programming system—one where ideas, logic, and language coexist in a loop of rigor and creativity.
